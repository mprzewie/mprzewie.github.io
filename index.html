<h1 id="aboutme">About me</h1>
    I am a PhD Student at the Jagiellonian University. I work with <a href="https://gmum.net/">GMUM</a> research group, 
    under the supervision of prof. Jacek Tabor and prof. Marek Śmieja.
    I am also a member of the <a href="https://ideas-ncbr.pl/en/research/zero-waste-machine-learning-in-computer-vision/">IDEAS NCBR Computer Vision group</a>, 
    led by prof. Tomasz Trzciński.
    <br>
    
    Research-wise, I am interested in efficient deep learning, particularly in low-data regimes. I work on topics such as:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Meta-Learning</b> - how to train models to learn novel tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Few-Shot Learning</b> - how to train models which can learn from very small amounts of data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Self-supervised Learning</b> - how to learn good model initializations from unlabeled data?
        </li>
    </ul>
